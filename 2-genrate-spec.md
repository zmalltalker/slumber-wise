 Draft a detailed, step-by-step blueprint for building this project. Then, once you have a solid plan, break it down into small, iterative chunks that build on each other. Look at these chunks and then go another round to break it into small steps. review the results and make sure that the steps are small enough to be implemented safely, but big enough to move the project forward. Iterate until you feel that the steps are right sized for this project. From here you should have the foundation to provide a series of prompts for a code-generation LLM that will implement each step. Prioritize best practices, and incremental progress, ensuring no big jumps in complexity at any stage. Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts, and ends with wiring things together. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't integrated into a previous step. Make sure and separate each prompt section. Use markdown. Each prompt should be tagged as text using code tags. The goal is to output prompts, but context, etc is important as well.

Below is a comprehensive, developer-ready specification for **SlumberWise**, our iOS hackathon app that transforms Apple HealthKit sleep data into a single “Next Best Action” using GPT. This specification consolidates all major requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, error strategies, and a testing plan so a developer can begin implementation right away.

---

## 1. Overview and Objectives

**Goal:** Build a SwiftUI-based iOS app, **SlumberWise**, that:

- Reads Apple HealthKit sleep data  
- Summarizes it into a JSON payload grouped by day and sleep stages  
- Sends this JSON to GPT (via an external API) to receive a concise recommendation (the “Next Best Action”)  
- Presents that action in a minimalist UI and encourages user engagement with triggers, short feedback loops, and simple reward animations.

We are limiting scope to:
1. _Sleep data only_ (from HealthKit)  
2. _Local data storage_ (using Swift Data)  
3. _Push notifications_ (one in the evening, one in the morning), plus a demo trigger  
4. _Minimal UI_ with a short onboarding flow for HealthKit permissions

---

## 2. Core Features

1. **Onboarding & HealthKit Permission**  
   - A simple onboarding screen explains why we need access to the user’s HealthKit sleep data (in friendly, non-legalese terms).  
   - The user grants permission to read **HKCategoryTypeIdentifierSleepAnalysis**.  
   - If permission is denied, the user is informed that advice can’t be generated without sleep data.

2. **Sleep Data Collection**  
   - Retrieve daily sleep data from HealthKit (last _n_ days, or just the most recent data each morning).  
   - Aggregate minutes in each stage: Core, Deep, REM, Awake (mapping from HKCategoryValueSleepAnalysis subtypes).  
   - Construct a JSON object like:
     ```json
     {
       "sleepData": [
         {
           "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
           "stages": [
             { "stage": "Core",  "minutes": 210 },
             { "stage": "Deep",  "minutes": 50  },
             { "stage": "REM",   "minutes": 40  },
             { "stage": "Awake", "minutes": 10  }
           ]
         },
         ...
       ]
     }
     ```

3. **GPT Integration**  
   - Use an external GPT API (e.g., OpenAI) to generate a single “Next Best Action.”  
   - The system prompt includes disclaimers (“You are not a medical professional,” etc.).  
   - The user prompt includes the JSON data and instructs GPT to provide a single short recommendation based on recent sleep data.

4. **Displaying the Next Best Action**  
   - A minimalist SwiftUI interface presents the new challenge (e.g., “Go to bed 30 minutes earlier”) each day.  
   - The user can tap a button **“Challenge Accepted”** to commit.  
   - Later, the user can tap **“Challenge Completed”** to mark it done.  
   - Completion triggers a small reward animation (e.g., subtle confetti) and logs the result in Swift Data.

5. **Storing User Progress (Swift Data)**  
   - Data model fields:  
     - `id` (UUID)  
     - `date` (Date) – when the challenge was generated  
     - `challengeName` (String) – short title (e.g., “Lights Out Earlier”)  
     - `challengeDescription` (String) – optional short details (from GPT)  
     - `category` (String) – e.g., “Bedtime routine,” “Screen time,” etc.  
     - `completed` (Bool)  
   - Stored locally (no server sync).

6. **Push Notifications**  
   - **Morning Notification**: After new sleep data becomes available (for hackathon, can be a fixed time or immediately after data retrieval). This notifies the user a new challenge is ready.  
   - **Evening Notification**: 21:30 local time, reminding the user to either accept or complete their challenge before bed.  
   - **Manual Demo Trigger**: If the user taps the screen 10 times quickly, a demo notification or next-best-action flow is triggered for demonstration purposes.

7. **Engagement Loop Mechanics**  
   - **Triggers**: Morning/evening push notifications (and optional manual trigger).  
   - **Action**: User opens the app, sees or accepts the challenge.  
   - **Variable Reward**: A light or more celebratory animation when completing challenges (random intensity).  
   - **Investment**: The user invests time in building a consistent habit.

## 3. Architecture & Implementation Details

### 3.1 Tech Stack
- **SwiftUI** for the UI.  
- **Apple HealthKit** (HKHealthStore) for sleep data.  
- **Swift Data** for local offline storage of challenges.  
- **UNUserNotificationCenter** for local notifications.  
- **URLSession** or third-party library to call GPT API.

### 3.2 Project Structure (Proposed)

1. **Models**  
   - `Challenge`: A Swift Data entity with the fields listed above.  
   - `SleepDay`: A struct or ephemeral data model to hold daily sleep metrics for building the JSON.

2. **View Models**  
   - `HealthKitManager`:  
     - Requests authorization for HKCategoryTypeIdentifierSleepAnalysis.  
     - Fetches sleep data daily, aggregates by day.  
     - Converts data to the required JSON format.  
   - `GPTManager`:  
     - Constructs the GPT prompt and calls the external GPT API.  
     - Returns a text-based recommendation.  
   - `ChallengesViewModel`:  
     - Stores new challenges in Swift Data.  
     - Updates completion status.  
     - Exposes currently active challenge to the UI.

3. **Views**  
   - **OnboardingView**:  
     - Explains why we need HealthKit access in a friendly tone.  
     - Has a “Grant Access” button that triggers HK authorization.  
   - **HomeView**:  
     - Shows the current challenge or a prompt to fetch a new one if none exists.  
     - Includes “Challenge Accepted” and “Challenge Completed” actions.  
   - **AnimationView** (or a simpler approach with SwiftUI’s built-in animations):  
     - Displays a small confetti or celebratory animation upon completion.

4. **Coordinators / App Flow**  
   - On first launch, show **OnboardingView** → request HK permissions → proceed to **HomeView**.  
   - At a specified time (morning/evening), or after tapping the screen 10 times (demo), the user is notified or navigated to the relevant screen to accept or complete a challenge.

### 3.3 HealthKit Integration

1. **Authorization**  
   ```swift
   let healthStore = HKHealthStore()
   // Request read permission for HKCategoryTypeIdentifierSleepAnalysis
   ```
2. **Data Fetching**  
   - Query for the last `n` days of sleep analysis data.  
   - Sum durations (in minutes) for each sleep stage.  
   - Group them by day and produce the JSON structure for GPT.

### 3.4 GPT Integration

1. **Prompt Construction**  
   - **System Prompt**: Provide disclaimers (“You are not a medical professional…”).  
   - **User Prompt**: Include the JSON with daily sleep data. Ask GPT for a single, concise recommendation.
2. **API Call**  
   - Use an HTTP POST request to the GPT API endpoint (OpenAI or similar).  
   - Example (OpenAI):
     ```swift
     let url = URL(string: "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions")!
     // Add headers (Authorization: Bearer <API Key>), JSON body with messages
     ```
3. **Parsing & Storing Response**  
   - Parse the JSON response from GPT to retrieve the recommended action text.  
   - Save as a new `Challenge` in Swift Data with `completed = false`.

## 4. Notifications & Scheduling

1. **Local Notifications**  
   - Request user permission for notifications.  
   - Schedule daily notifications at:  
     - **Morning**: A fixed time (e.g., 07:00) or triggered after data fetch. For hackathon, you can hardcode a time.  
     - **Evening**: 21:30.  
2. **Manual Trigger**  
   - Detect 10 rapid taps on the screen.  
   - Immediately trigger the flow that fetches data, calls GPT, and schedules/launches a local notification (for demo).

---

## 5. Data Handling and Privacy

1. **HealthKit**  
   - Read-only access to sleep data.  
   - Must have an explanation on why we need sleep data.  
2. **Local Storage**  
   - All challenge data is stored in Swift Data on-device only.  
   - The app does not upload personal info to any backend.  
3. **GPT API**  
   - Sleep data is sent to GPT as aggregated daily metrics, with no personally identifying information.  
   - The user should be aware of the third-party API usage.

---

## 6. Error Handling & Edge Cases

1. **HealthKit Permission Denied**  
   - Show a fallback screen: “We can’t generate personalized advice without sleep data. Please enable permissions in Settings.”  
2. **No Recent Sleep Data**  
   - If no data is found for a day, skip or mark it as 0 minutes.  
   - App can still provide a generic recommendation from GPT.  
3. **GPT API Failure**  
   - Present a generic error message: “We couldn’t get a recommendation right now. Please try again later.”  
   - Optionally schedule a retry or fallback to a cached default suggestion.  
4. **Notification Permission Denied**  
   - The user can still see their next best action in the app; no push notifications are triggered.

---

## 7. Testing Plan

1. **Unit Tests**  
   - **HealthKitManagerTests**:  
     - Mocks HealthKit responses, tests correct grouping & JSON formatting.  
   - **GPTManagerTests**:  
     - Mocks GPT responses. Verifies prompt construction & response parsing.  
   - **ChallengesViewModelTests**:  
     - Tests creating, retrieving, updating challenges in Swift Data.  
2. **UI Tests**  
   - **Onboarding Flow**:  
     - Ensure that tapping “Grant Access” triggers HealthKit permission.  
     - If user denies permission, verify fallback UI.  
   - **Home Screen**:  
     - Check that the challenge displays.  
     - Test Accept → Completed flow.  
     - Validate reward animation triggers correctly.  
3. **Push Notification Tests**  
   - Verify notifications appear at 21:30 and at the set morning time.  
   - Test the manual trigger (10 taps) to confirm a notification is fired.  
4. **Edge Cases**  
   - No sleep data returned.  
   - GPT timeouts or invalid JSON in the response.  
   - The user never completes a challenge or completes multiple challenges in one day.

---

## 8. Next Steps

1. **Set Up Development Environment**  
   - Xcode with iOS SDK  
   - SwiftUI + Swift Data integration  
2. **Implement HealthKit Permissions & Sleep Queries**  
   - Construct a function that returns daily aggregated sleep data.  
3. **Integrate GPT**  
   - Store API keys securely (e.g., in an environment file or keychain).  
   - Create a request to OpenAI or the chosen GPT API endpoint with system & user prompts.  
4. **Develop SwiftUI Interface**  
   - OnboardingView → HomeView flow.  
   - Minimal screens for Challenge acceptance & completion.  
   - Animated reward on completion.  
5. **Add Notifications**  
   - Request notification permissions.  
   - Schedule morning & evening notifications.  
   - Add manual trigger logic.  
6. **Test & Validate**  
   - Run unit/UI tests.  
   - Confirm push notifications function as intended.  
   - Ensure GPT responses are displayed properly.

## Final Notes

- **App Name**: **SlumberWise**  
- **Tone & Style**: Minimalist, calming colors, supportive language.  
- **Engagement Mechanics**: Hook model triggers, variable reward animations, and straightforward user actions (accept/complete challenge).  
- **Privacy**: Emphasize local data storage; disclaimers about GPT usage; no PII.  

With this specification, a developer can begin coding the SwiftUI project, set up HealthKit and GPT integrations, structure local data models, and implement the notification flow. This design aims for a polished yet lightweight MVP, suitable for a hackathon demo or a foundation for a more robust future product.
